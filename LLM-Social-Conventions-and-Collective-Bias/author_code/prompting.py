  Context: Player 1 is playing a multi-round partnership game with Player 2 for 100 rounds.
  At each round, Player 1 and Player 2 simultaneously pick an action from the following values: {options}.
  The payoff that both players get is determined by the following rule:
  1. If Players play the SAME action as each other, they will both be REWARDED with payoff +{correct} points.
  2. If Players play DIFFERENT actions to each other, they will both be PUNISHED with payoff {incorrect} points.
  The objective of each Player is to maximize their own accumulated point tally, conditional on the behavior of the other player.
